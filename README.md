# Betrayal
Betrayal is a multiplayer turn-based game where you can team up or turn on your friends! Choose to be a warrior to deal the most damage, a knight to defend your teammates, a thief to increase gold reward amounts, or a priest to boost your team's stats. As you reach the top, you can choose to either fight with your team or betray them to get stronger. Betray to live, or live to be betrayed.
